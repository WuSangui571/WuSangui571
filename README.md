### 🧭 About Me

I'm a graduate student in Computer Science, currently focusing on **Java backend & full-stack development**.  
I care deeply about **clarity, structure, and boundaries** — in systems, in code, and in thinking.

I tend to believe that:

- good software is *designed*, not assembled  
- complexity should be earned, not assumed  
- and most problems become smaller once they are described precisely  

I enjoy building things slowly, understanding them from the inside out.

Outside of code, I train regularly.  
Not for competition, but for **discipline, feedback, and long-term consistency**.

### 🎯 What I’m Working Toward

- Becoming someone who can **design and reason about entire systems**, not just write features  
- Building software that is **maintainable, understandable, and honest**  
- Keeping a personal technical archive — notes, projects, and reflections — that compounds over time  

I’m less interested in trends, and more interested in **foundations**.

### 🌐 Writing & Notes

🌱 **[sangui.top](https://sangui.top)**  

A personal blog where I write about:

- programming and system design  
- learning processes and mistakes  
- methods, habits, and long-term thinking  

No algorithms for traffic.  
Just notes meant to be revisited.

> “Write to understand. Keep what survives.”

### 🧩 Personal Notes

- I prefer **clean file structures** and consistent formatting  
- I believe logic is not opposed to creativity — it protects it  
- Nostalgic music sometimes says more than documentation  
- Simplicity is often the result of restraint, not lack of effort
